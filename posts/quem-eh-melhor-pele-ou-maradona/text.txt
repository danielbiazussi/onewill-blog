#Qual a importância desse no mundo?

I believe that your problem is due to the fact that -
is not a word character. Thus, the word boundary will match after the -,
and so will not capture it. Word boundaries match before the first and after
the last word characters in a string, as well as any place where before it is
a word character or non-word character, and after it is the opposite.
Also note that word boundary is a zero-width match.

#Como fazer para contonar isso?

Note: I'm not sure what to do about mistakes in text, like
when someone doesn't put a space after a period at the end of a sentence.
I allowed for it, but I'm not sure that it's necessarily the right thing to do.

Anyway, in Java, if you're searching text for the those weird-named languages,
you need to replace the \b with before and after whitespace and punctuation
designators.
