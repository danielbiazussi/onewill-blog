        <h1 id="1">It's hard to gauge time.</h1>
<p>I believe that <strong>your problem</strong> is due to the fact that -
is not a word character. Thus, the word boundary will match after the -,
and so will not capture it. Word boundaries match before the first and after
the last word characters in a string, as well as any place where before it is
a word character or non-word character, and after it is the opposite.</p>
<p><a href="http://showdown.github.io/">Showdown link</a></p>
<p>Also note that word boundary is a zero-width match.</p>

<h1 id="2"> I spent so much time making sweet</h1>
<p>I just haven't had sex in a month. You know, you've been here two months.
It's hard to gauge time.</p>

<h1 id="3">Michael, look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered?</h1>
<p>Anyway, in Java, if you're searching text for the those weird-named languages,
you need to replace the \b with before and after whitespace and punctuation
designators.</p>
<h1 id="4">Are all the guys in here… you know?</h1>
<p>It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib.
No. I was ashamed to be <em>seen</em> with you. I like being with you. This show was cancelled.
I mean, COME ON. I need a fake passport, preferably to France… I like the way they
think. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this
$3,000 suit. COME ON.</p>
<h1 id="5">She's not 'that Mexican', Mom.</h1>
<p>Can't a guy call his mother pretty without it seeming strange? Amen.
And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cute! It's so watery.
And yet there's a smack of ham to it. She's trying to prove that she's closer
to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't
know how little I care for GOB.</p>
<p>"Circumvent." It means "to go around." Gob: The old "reach around."
I am getting rid of this thing. It has caused me nothing but pride and
self-respect. You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet.
Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing
grab-ass in the shower. After all, why should you go to jail for a crime somebody
else noticed?</p>
<h1 id="6">Popcorn shrimp</h1>
<p>Whenever she'd change clothes, she'd make me wait on the balcony until zip-up,
and yet anything goes at bath time. I didn't mean who… I meant… her?
I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.) Oh please. They didn't sneak
into this country to be your friends. ♪♪ It ain't easy being white. It ain't easy
being brown. ♪♪ Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's
hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. I believe you will find the dessert
to be both engrossing and high-grossing! So we don't get dessert?</p>
